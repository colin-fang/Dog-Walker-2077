WELCOME TO DOGWALKER 2077

DIRECTIONAL KEYS FOR MOVEMENT
SPACEBAR FOR JUMP

IN THE PET SELECTION MENU YOU CAN CHOOSE BETWEEN PLAYING WITH A DOG OR A CAT
THE CAT MOVES FASTER THAN THE DOG

YOUR PET WILL FOLLOW YOU UNTIL IT IS WITHIN A CERTAIN DISTANCE OF YOU
IF YOUR PET IS CLOSE TO THE ENEMY TRUCK WHILE WITHIN THE SAME DISTANCE IT WILL ATTACK THE TRUCK
IF YOU TOUCH THE FRONT OF THE TRUCK YOU WILL DIE
YOU CAN JUMP ON TOP OF THE TRUCK SAFELY
AVOID THE TRUCK WHILE BEING CLOSE ENOUGH THAT YOUR PET CAN DAMAGE IT
